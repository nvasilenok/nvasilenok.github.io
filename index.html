 	<p>Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Stanford University. My research examines how <em>ideas</em>, <em>knowledge</em>, and <em>institutions</em> emerge, evolve, and spread across historical and contemporary contexts. Methodologically, my work emphasizes the use of previously unexplored data sources, such as archival collections and texts.</p>

 	<p>I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market with a strong preference for positions in Europe. You can find my CV <a href="pdfs/CV_Vasilenok.pdf">here</a>.</p>

 	<p>In the 2025-2026 academic year, I am a Graduate Fellow at the King Center on Global Development, a Dixon and Carol Doll Graduate Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, and a Dissertation Fellow at the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences.</p>

 	<p>I am a co-founder of the Stanford Historical Social Science Workshop, which aims to foster dialogue among students from political science, economics, and history. The workshop schedule is available on <a href="https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/hssw/home">our website</a>.</p>

 	<p>Before starting my doctoral studies, I earned a B.A. with honours in Political Science and an M.A. in Sociology from the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, Russia. In 2024, I also received an M.A. in Economics at Stanford University.</p>

 	<p>A native of Kaliningrad, Russia (formerly Königsberg in Preußen), I am passionate about architectural preservation and urban history. Growing up among German ruins interspersed with Soviet blocs made me reflect on how nations' traumatic pasts shape political identities in the present.</p>

  <p>Whenever I travel to a new place, I go for a run, take a walking architecture tour, and visit local used books and yarn stores there.</p>
