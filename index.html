 	<p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Stanford University. My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics, political economy, and economic history. I study the dissemination of ideas and institutional development in both historical and contemporary perspectives. My work emphasizes the use of previously unexplored data sources, such as archival collections and texts.</p>

 	<p>I am a co-founder of the Stanford Historical Social Science Workshop, which aims to foster dialogue among students from the disciplines of political science, economics, and history. The workshop schedule is available on <a href="https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/hssw/home">our website</a>.</p>

 	<p>I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market with a strong preference for positions in Europe.</p>

 	<p>Prior to starting my graduate studies, I received a B.A. in Political Science and an M.A. in Sociology from the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, Russia. I also earned an M.A. in Economics at Stanford University. </p>
