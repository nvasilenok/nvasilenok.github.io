<div><p>This paper examines knowledge spillovers across ethnic boundaries. Using the case of skilled German immigrants in the Russian Empire, we study technology adoption among Russian peasants. We find that distance to German settlements predicts the prevalence of heavy iron ploughs, fanning mills and wheat sowing among Russians, who traditionally ploughed with a light wooden ard and sowed rye. The main channel of technology adoption was German fairs. We show that heavy ploughs increased the labor productivity of Russian peasants. However, communication barriers precluded Russians from adopting skill-intensive occupations like blacksmithing, mechanics, carpentry, and other crafts. The results suggest that skilled immigrants may enhance local development through the introduction of advanced tools without transmitting their skills to a receiving society.</p></div>

<div class = "text"><p>In this paper, we empirically uncover the determinants of infant mortality in the Russian Empire in the late 19th–early 20th centuries. In the European part of the Empire, infant mortality exhibited substantial spatial variation comparable to that in whole Europe. Contemporaneous micro-level medical studies suggest that this variation was mainly due to ethnic-specific child care practices. In particular, Russian practices of early introduction of supplementary food and short breastfeeding period were detrimental to infants’ health. Consistent with the micro-level evidence, our regressions show that the single best predictor of infant mortality rate is the share of ethnic Russians. In contrast, development measures fail to explain both temporal and spatial variation in infant mortality. Our results imply caution in using infant mortality rate as a measure of living standards in Imperial Russia. </p></div>
