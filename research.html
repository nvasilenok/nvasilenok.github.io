<br>
<div class = "text"><p>How do individuals choose between formal and customary institutions? In developing countries, modernizing reforms, such as the introduction of formal land titling, often lag in the popular take-up despite their potential economic benefits. Focusing on the 1906 land reform in the Russian Empire, I examine the factors driving peasants’ choice to break away from a traditional institution of peasant commune that governed land tenure in favor of private property rights provided by the state. Taking advantage of newly digitized data covering 2,500 peasant communes in the province of Simbirsk in the southeastern part of European Russia in 1910–11, I argue that the demand for formal titling depended on the expected returns it provided in comparison to communal institutions. I show that peasants tended to take advantage of the reform whenever they perceived their property rights as insecure. However, if a commune offered a safety net by guaranteeing access to land to its members, the demand for land titling decreased. My results imply that the design of land reforms should account for the potential effects of customary institutions.</p></div>

<div class = "text"><p>The Russian Empire had the highest infant mortality rate in Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century. Using a variety of official statistical sources and qualitative evidence, this paper documents uniquely high infant mortality among ethnic Russians. In contrast, among other ethnic groups of the Empire infant mortality rates did not exceed those of the European countries by much. The evidence suggests that the explanation for the Russian infant mortality pattern was ethnic-specific infant care practices, such as the early introduction of solid food, which increased the incidence of lethal gastrointestinal diseases. Our findings highlight the importance of traditional infant feeding practices for mortality in pre-industrial societies.</p></div>

<div><p>This paper examines knowledge spillovers across ethnic boundaries. Using the case of skilled German immigrants in the Russian Empire, we study technology adoption among Russian peasants. We find that distance to German settlements predicts the prevalence of heavy iron ploughs, fanning mills and wheat sowing among Russians, who traditionally ploughed with a light wooden ard and sowed rye. The main channel of technology adoption was German fairs. We show that heavy ploughs increased the labor productivity of Russian peasants. However, communication barriers precluded Russians from adopting skill-intensive occupations like blacksmithing, mechanics, carpentry, and other crafts. The results suggest that skilled immigrants may enhance local development through the introduction of advanced tools without transmitting their skills to a receiving society.</p></div>
