<div><h4>Skilled Immigrants and Technology Adoption: Evidence from the German Settlements in the Russian Empire <span class="h4">(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/natkhov">Timur Natkhov</a>)</span></h4>

<div><p>This paper examines knowledge spillovers across ethnic boundaries. Using the case of skilled German immigrants in the Russian Empire, we study technology adoption among Russian peasants. We find that distance to German settlements predicts the prevalence of heavy iron ploughs, fanning mills and wheat sowing among Russians, who traditionally ploughed with a light wooden ard and sowed rye. The main channel of technology adoption was German fairs. We show that heavy ploughs increased the labor productivity of Russian peasants. However, communication barriers precluded Russians from adopting skill-intensive occupations like blacksmithing, mechanics, carpentry, and other crafts. The results suggest that skilled immigrants may enhance local development through the introduction of advanced tools without transmitting their skills to a receiving society.</p></div>

<div><h4>Ethnic-Specific Infant Care Practices and Infant Mortality in Late Imperial Russia <span class="h4">(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/natkhov">Timur Natkhov</a>)</span></h4>

<div class = "text"><p>The Russian Empire had the highest infant mortality rate in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. This paper documents uniquely high infant mortality among ethnic Russians. In contrast, infant mortality rates among other ethnic groups of the Empire did not exceed those of the European countries by much. Using a variety of official statistical sources and qualitative evidence, we suggest that the explanation for the Russian infant mortality pattern was ethnic-specific infant care practices, such as early weaning and the introduction of solid food. Our findings call for caution in using infant mortality rates as a proxy for standards of living in pre-industrial societies.</p></div>
