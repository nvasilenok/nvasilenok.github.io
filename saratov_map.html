 	<p>This webpage presents a companion interactive map to our "Skilled Immigrants and Technology Adoption" paper published in <i>Explorations in Economic History</i> in July 2021. The map overlays figures from the paper with additional historical data and the Google basemap enabling a reader to customize the map's content and zoom in on different parts of the map. The pop-up windows that appear after clicking on polygons show the exact numbers used in coloring the map.<p> 
 	<p>Below I provide the details on data sources and give references to the additional literature inviting a reader to more thouroughly engage with the history of Saratov Germans.</p>

<p>The map shows the historical borders of the townships (<i>volost</i>) and districts (<i>uezd</i>) of Saratov province of the Russian Empire. The township borders correspond to 1913 and have been digitized from the <i><a href="http://elib.shpl.ru/ru/nodes/26717-spiski-naselennyh-mest-saratovskoy-gubernii-saratov-1914" target="_blank">List of settlements of Saratov province</a></i> published by the Saratov provincial zemstvo. Data on the location of railroads, rural fairs, and German settlements come from the same source.</p>
<p>The layers showing (a) the share of Germans in the township population in 1897, (b) the number of iron ploughs and (c) fanning mills per household in 1913, and (d) the share of households engaged in craftsmanship in 1917 rely on the township-level data. The population density in 1763, on the eve of the German immigration to the Russian Empire, has been measured at the district level. Yellow dots correspond to the location of villages that held a rural fair in 1913. All these layers come from the original paper.</p>
<p>The interactive map contains three additional layers not reported in the original paper. Two layers visualize the area designated for the foreign settlement by the 1764 Law (Law #12095 in the <i><a href="https://nlr.ru/e-res/law_r/search.php" target="_blank">Complete Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire</a></i>). Red diamongs represent the reference points explicitely mentioned in the law:</p>
<p id="quote">"...from the Chardym Island to Tsaritsyn, from Tsaritsyn to the Don fortress, and futher to the unnamed river that flows into the Don, and then to the Medveditsa river and further to the Khoper river, and from the Khoper up the Don river to the Bityug river, and then following the Bityug to its source, and from the source of the Bityug river to Novokhoperskaya, and from there up the Khoper river to the Znamenskoye and Dolgorukovo villages, and then following the Penza border to Saratov district, and then crossing the Saratov districts by smaller rivers back to the Chardym Island."</p>
<p>The 1764 Law refers to the map of the suggested area; that map, however, does not appear in the <i>Complete Collection of Laws</i>. It may have been lost or may still exist in the archives, but we could not identify its location. The red polygon reconstructs the settlement area connecting the diamonds either by straight lines or by rivers whenever this is indicated by the Law. Our interactive map demonstrates how much the
